# Web Tree

This is one of my first projects, a self-building SVG tree made up of squares and triangles (with a terrible performance).  
Its style reminds the Pythagorean trees, but this tree is randomly generated and always different.

The [Web Tree webpage](https://edof0.github.io/web-tree/) is visible on GitHub pages.

The project won't be updated in its logic because it should match the original version: this repository is linked to my CV.
