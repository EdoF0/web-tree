# Web Tree

This is one of my first projects, a self-building SVG tree made up of squares and triangles (with a terrible performance).  
Its style reminds the Pythagorean trees, but this tree is randomly generated and always different.

The project won't be updated in its logic because it should match the original version: this repository is linked to my CV.
